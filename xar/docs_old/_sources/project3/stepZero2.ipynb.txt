    "It is best practice to start with an informal scoping phase that focuses on understanding, probing the challenge, and sketching a preliminary solution, before entering structured development. \n",

    "It's where creativity meets physics and feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Quick Conceptualization & Brainstorming**\n",
    "* Sketch rough ideas of the system configuration: where the pendulum is mounted, how the mechnical system is fixed, how the wheel is attached and rotates, where the motor and sensor go, where the wires go.\n",
    "* Discuss what the main goal is: e.g., swing-up and stabilization.\n",
    "* Look at reference examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations**\n",
    "* Estimate:\n",
    "  * Mass and length of the pendulum ($m$, $l$)\n",
    "  * Moment of inertia of the reaction wheel ($I$)\n",
    "  * Required torque ($\\tau = I \\alpha$) during bang-bang swing-up, and during PID or LQR stabilization.\n",
    "  * Approximate rotational speed ranges ($\\omega$)\n",
    "* Check if motor power, voltage, and gear ratio are within reach.\n",

    "**3. Quick and Dirty Prototype**\n",
    "* Build a first rudimentary prototype using:\n",
    "  * Readily available parts (LEGO, wood, printed parts, scrap electronics)\n",
    "  * A simple DC motor and basic wheel (plastic or metal disk)\n",
    "  * Temporary mounts (tape, clamps, hot glue, cardboard)\n",
    "* Power the motor manually (e.g., via a lab supply or battery) and observe the dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Physics Scoping and Trade-offs**\n",
    "* Identify key physical quantities to control: torque, angular position, friction.\n",
    "* Recognize constraints:\n",
    "  * Voltage/current limits of motors\n",
    "  * Sensor resolution (e.g., AS5600 for angle)\n",
    "  * Microcontroller limitations (timing, ADC resolution)\n",
    "* Think about trade-offs:\n",
    "  * Larger wheel = more inertia, but heavier\n",
    "  * Faster motor = higher voltage/power needs\n",
    "  * Longer pendulum = slower dynamics but easier to observe\n",
