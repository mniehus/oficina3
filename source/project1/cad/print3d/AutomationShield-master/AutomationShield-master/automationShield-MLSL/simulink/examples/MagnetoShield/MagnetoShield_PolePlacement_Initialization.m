%   MAGNETOSHIELD Pole-placement simulation and control initialization for Simulink
%
%   Code below is used as an initialization script for MagnetoShield system
%   and default properties can be changed via this script.
%   This example reads the linearized model of the MagnetoShield device,
%   then expands it with an integrator and then computes Pole-placement
%   gain based on chosen poles. For computation the Ackermann's formula
%   was used. For estimation of the states is used Luenberger's observer
%   and suitable form of Ackermann's formula was applied as well.
%   Consequently are the model properties as stability, controlability,
%   observability, step and impulse response evaluated and displayed. 
%   Root-locus plot is shown too.
