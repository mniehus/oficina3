%   LinkShield NAF/PPF controller computation
% 
%   This file computes a negagtive acceleration feedback (positive position
%   feedback controller for the LinkShield device.
%
%   The file reads the single mode vibration model, from which it needs the
%   assumed angular natural frequency of the system. From this constructs
%   a PPF controller by compensating for the fact that the device reads 
%   acceleration signal instead of position. The transfer function is 
%   discretized and turned into a difference equation form. The open
%   and closed-loop response of the system is compared in simulation.
