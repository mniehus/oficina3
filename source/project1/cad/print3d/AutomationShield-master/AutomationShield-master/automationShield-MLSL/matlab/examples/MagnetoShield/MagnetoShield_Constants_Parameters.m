%   MAGNETOSHIELD Constants and parameters 
%
%   The code below describes the experiment how to calculate approximate  
%   number of turns of the coil of the electromagnet based on the Magnetic
%   flux density measurements and calculation of the initial guess of the
%   constant K used in the non-linear and linear model of the MagnetoShield.
%   Power supply of the electromagnet is 5 V.
%   Used Hall sensor A1302KUA-T.

% CONSTANTS AND DIMENSIONS
l_coil = (12.6-2.14)/1000;  % Height of the coil [m]
r_coil = (9.8+15)/4/1000;   % Approximate radius of the coil [m]
x = 12.6/1000;    % Distance of the hall sensor from the base of the electormagnet [m]
S_coil = pi*r_coil^2;
Sens = 1.3*10^(-3);     % Sensitivity of the hall sensor [V/G]
mio = 4*pi*10^(-7);     % Permeability of the vacuum
mir_f = 5000;            % Relative permeability of the iron
mi_f = mio * mir_f;     % Permeability of the environment - ferrite
mir_a = 1.00000037;     % Relative permeability of the air
mi_a = mio*mir_a;       % Permeability of the environment - air

% MEASURED DATA
U = 2.45;           % Measured Hall sensor output - no magnetic field [V]
U_field = 1.951;    % Measured Hall sensor output - magnetic field of the electomagnet[V]
Bg = (U-U_field)/Sens;    % Measured Magnetic flux density in Gauss [G]
B = Bg/10000;             % Measured Magnetic flux density in Tesla [T]
I_coil = 102.1/1000;      % Measured current through the coil [A]

% APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF TURNS OF THE ELECTROMAGNET:
N = B*2/(mi_f*I_coil)*1/(x/sqrt(r_coil^2+x^2)+(l_coil-x)/sqrt(r_coil^2+(l_coil-x)^2));
% INIIAL COMPUTATION OF THE CONSTANT K:
K = mi_a^2*N^2*S_coil/(2*mio);
