  MAGNETOSHIELD EXPLICIT MPC EXAMPLE

  WARNING: This is an experimental example and it does
            not work properly.

  This example uses the "empc" module for the online part of
  explicit model predictive control (EMPC, Explicit MPC). The
  "Sequential()" function implements a simple sequential search
  for the region with the current state, then computes the PWA
  control law associated with it. The sequential search algorithm
  has been re-written to Python based on the original found in the
  Multi-Parametric Toolbox (MPT) of Kvasnica et. al
  (see. http://www.mpt3.org). The definition of the controller
  itself is auto-generated by MPT in MATLAB, see the empcToPython.m
  function.

  Tested with the following boards
  - Adafruit Metro M4 Express (1)

  (1) Code runs, however, levitation is not achieved. The issue is timing,
  as the sequential search takes way too long to fit into the 5 ms
  sampling limit.

  papers. A list of publications connected to the AutomationShield
