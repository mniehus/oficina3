  MagnetoShield Power Calibration Experiment

  Upload the code to your board, then log and export the data
  using a serial terminal. The code goes through analog levels
  supplied into the DAC module, then measures true voltage and
  current. Although due to the internal hardware design the response
  should be fairly linear, this can be (and is) used to create a
  calibration curve.

  Tested with Adafruit Metro M4 Express.
