  MagnetoShield closed-loop identification experiment

  Runs a closed-loop experiment to gather data for system
  identification.

  This example initializes the sampling and PID control
  subsystems from the AutomationShield modules and starts a
  predetermined reference trajectory. Noise is injected to
  this input trajectory to create a rich signal suitable for
  system identification. Upload the code to your board along
  with the necessary module then use a serial terminal software
  or Matlab to acquire the dataset for later processing.

  WARNING: Do not use "Mu" for data acquisition.
  WARNING: This is "soft real-time", the timing is not perfect,
           yet, it is possible to gather meaningful data for
           identification.
  WARNING: It is unlikely that the Metro M0 or other less
           powerful boards handle this code properly, timing
           will be unreliable, thus, model quality will suffer.

  Tested with the
    - Adafruit Metro M4 Express (CircuitPython 5.3.1).
