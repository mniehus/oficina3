   MAGNETOSHIELD PYTHON MINIMAL COMMUNICATION SPEED TEST

   WARNING: This example is under development and does not work as
            expected!!! Suspected cause is, that the time.monotonic
            function is not granular enough to perform the measurement.

   This example tests for the absolute minimal sampling period that is
   achievable with this shield using Python. The script just tests reading the
   analog input and sending data to the I2C bus without attempting feedback
   control, as these are the most essential operations required for control.
