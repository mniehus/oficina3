  MagnetoShield automatic distance calibration experiment

  This example initializes the MagnetoShield and measures
  the Hall sensor output with the electromagnet turned
  on and off. It returns the minimal and maximal ADC levels,
  equivalent magnetic flux in Gauss and the position as
  estimated by a power curve.

  Upload the code to your board, then open the Serial
  Plotter function in your Arduino IDE. You may change the
  reference trajectory in the code.

  Tested with Adafruit Metro M4 Express.
