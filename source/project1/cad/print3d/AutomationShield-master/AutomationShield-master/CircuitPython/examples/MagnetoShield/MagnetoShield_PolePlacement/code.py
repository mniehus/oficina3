   MagnetoShield pole placement example

   This example reads uses the linearized model of the MagnetoShield
   and the pole placement gain calculated in the
   MagnetoShield_PolePlacement_Simulation.m example in MATLAB.
   The state measurement can be performed directly by reading the position
   and current values, then differentiating for the velocity.

  Tested with the following boards
  - Adafruit Metro M4 Express (1),(4)
  - Adafruit Metro M0 Express (2),(3)
  - Adafruit Metro M4 Grand Central (1),(4)

  (1) Runs as expected. Mu cannot keep up with data output, use external means to log.
  (2) Runs only without serial output.
  (3) Serious degradation visible, might stabilize only for a while, increase sampling if possible
  (4) Strict real-time not achievable
