  CircuitPython API for the MagnetoShield didactic hardware.

  The file is a part of the application programmers interface for
  the MagnetoShield didactic tool for control engineering and
  mechatronics education. The MagnetoShield implements a magnetic
  levitation experiment on an Arduino shield. The MagnetoShield is
  compatible with CircuitPython enabled boards, such as the
  Adafruit Metro M4 Express.
