    "Arduino microcontrollers are widely used for real-time control systems due to their simplicity, low cost, and large ecosystem of libraries and tutorials. In this project, the Arduino is responsible for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reading sensor data (e.g., from the AS5600 magnetic rotary sensor)\n",
    "- Running the control algorithm (Bang-Bang, PID, or LQR)\n",
    "- Sending the command to the motor driver to actuate the reaction wheel\n",

    "**Typical Setup Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno / Nano / Mega  \n",
    "- **Sensor**: AS5600 magnetic rotary position sensor (via I2C)  \n",
    "- **Actuator**: Brushed DC motor + motor driver (e.g., L298N or TB6612FNG)  \n",
    "- **Power supply**: Appropriate for motor and controller (check ratings!)  \n",
    "- **Other**: Wires, resistors, capacitors, breadboards or PCBs  \n",

    "Migrating from Python Simulation to Arduino Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "In your development process, you will first simulate the control system (e.g., pendulum dynamics and reaction wheel behavior) using Python. This allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore different parameters (e.g., control gains, system constants)\n",
    "- Test various controllers (Bang-Bang, PID, LQR)\n",
    "- Validate system stability in idealized and perturbed conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the control strategy is selected and tuned in Python, **you will port the core control logic to C/C++ in the Arduino IDE**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Isolate the control algorithm** from your Python code (e.g., a function that outputs control action given angle and velocity).\n",
    "2. **Rewrite this logic in Arduino-compatible C++**, respecting memory and computation constraints.\n",
    "3. Replace Python’s simulated sensor and motor interfaces with real-time reads from the AS5600 and motor driver control (e.g., `analogWrite()` or `digitalWrite()`).\n",
    "4. Use Arduino’s `loop()` and `millis()` to structure periodic execution of your control loop (e.g., 100 Hz update rate).\n",
    "5. Calibrate your sensors and actuators to reflect real-world behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Real hardware behaves differently than simulations — expect to tune your controller gains again!\n",
    "\n",
    "By mirroring your software architecture between simulation and deployment, you ensure a smoother transition and better reuse of your logic."
